public code from tutoring sessions

This repository contains code from a variety of examples I have worked through with students. It is a work in progress as I go back through a few hundred past sessions and collect relevant code. 

Examples will include linear and nonlinear modeling, deep learning,  geospatial work, data visualization, statistical tests and others. Most work is in R and some will be in Python.

The intent here is to teach, so for more advanced users, please note that comments in the code will be stating the obvious fairly often.
