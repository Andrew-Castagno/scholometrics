# scholometrics
public code for teaching

This repository contains code from a variety of examples I have worked through with students. It is a work in progress as I convert past lessons to be compatible with publicly available data. 

Examples will include linear and nonlinear modeling, deep learning,  geospatial work, data visualization, statistical tests and more. Most work is in R and some will be in Python.

Necessary files to run any code will be stored within the repository. 

Much of this code is intended to be understandable for beginners and intermediate users, so for more advanced users, please note that comments in the code will sometimes be stating the obvious.
