public code from tutoring sessions

This repository contains code from a variety of examples I have done with students. It is a work in progress as I go back through a few hundred past sessions and collect relevant code. 

Examples will include linear and nonlinear modeling, deep learning,  geospatial work, data visualization, statistical tests and others. Most work is in R and some will be in Python.
